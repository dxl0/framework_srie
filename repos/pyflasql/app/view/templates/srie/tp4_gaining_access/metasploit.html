            The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical
            hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it is an open-source framework,
            it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.

            With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to
            probe for weak spots. As another flavor of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the
            information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.
